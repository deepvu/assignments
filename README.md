## Census Income Prediction


#### Please time your work, and report the exact time.
 

Your task is to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell.

Even though this seems like a fairly straightforward task, there are so many ways you can explore, visualize, engineer your features, and tell a story with this data. It will be interesting to see your approaches! Some important questions to think about are: how can you best explore and visualize the data? Why did you select your particular model? How did you validate your model? What insights can you derive from your results?

Pay particular attention to coding style and how you present your findings - communicate your critical thinking, **tell a data story.** Please code and annotate your analysis in a Jupyter notebook. 


Note, you can search online for code syntax but not for solutions to this or similar problems.
